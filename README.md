Are dotfile repositories still cool?

eslint config is for an example React project. I don't remember why I decided not to use airbnb, probably because there were too many rules to disable (like jsx-no-bind and presumably other things)

prettier config goes along with eslint, especially important to enable `"trailingComma": "all"`

remember to
```
yarn add --dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-babel eslint-plugin-jest eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react
```

pylint is basically the default but I disabled rules I didn't like. pylint is completely useless without black.

my vimrc is very lame for how much I use vim. Maybe storing it in a repository will be encouragement to make it less lame.
