eslint config is for an example React project. I don't remember why I decided not to use airbnb, probably because there were too many rules to disable (like jsx-no-bind and presumably other things)

prettier config goes along with eslint, especially important to enable `"trailingComma": "all"`

remember to
```
yarn add --dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-babel eslint-plugin-jest eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react
```
